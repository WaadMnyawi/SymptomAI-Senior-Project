# SymptomAI-Senior-Project
 Using Artificial Intelligence in Early Diagnosis of Common Diseases



SymptomAI is a smart web-based medical diagnosis system developed as a senior graduation project. It allows users to input symptoms, receive predictions of possible diseases using a machine learning model, and facilitates treatment planning by doctors. The system also generates medical reports and includes validation mechanisms for medical accuracy.

## üîç Features
- Users input symptoms through an easy-to-use form
- Predicts possible diseases using a trained machine learning model (Decision Tree)
- Suggests recommended medical examinations based on the diagnosis
- Doctors can:
  - Review user cases and predicted disease
  - Confirm the diagnosis
  - Write and save treatment plans
  - Validate reports
- Generates downloadable and printable medical reports in **PDF** format
